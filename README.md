# Workflow

**Main event planner / Initiative lead** will be referred in this doc as "Techey"

### 1. Preparation

As much lead time as possible before the event, 2 weeks sounds ideal

1. Techey figures out the details of their event and what they require from Marketing
2. Techey fills out the [Creative Brief](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1fMny8cb3APT8g9joTy34zQ1EwI8adsAV1_QOgpUGImE/). Remember to include the following in the Brief, if applicable:
  - prerequisites
  - exactly what they will make
  - what they should install in advance and how
  - how get into the building
  - wifi credentials for non-NYU
  - where and how to RSVP beforehand
3. Marketing will send back any assets and guidance requested in the Creative Brief and asks for Techey's approval - **JY**
4. Techey approves or makes any requests for changes via email
5. In the event that Techey does not respond, Marketing will send 1 follow up email. Failure to respond to this email will result in Marketing deciding what to do at their discretion (most likely go ahead) - **JY**

### 2. Online

1. Marketing will take the approved Creative Brief and input the data into the API via Intranet - **JY**
2. Marketing will then make a Facebook event with the data from the Intranet and will let the e-board know (via Slack?) - **CW**
